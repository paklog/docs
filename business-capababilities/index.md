## Documentation Structure

Each business domain contains:

### Summary Documents
- High-level capability overview
- Key business processes
- Integration touchpoints
- Performance indicators

### Detailed Documents
- Comprehensive capability descriptions
- Process flows and rules
- Data models and entities
- API specifications
- Event definitions
- Error handling procedures

## How to Navigate

### For Business Users
1. Start with the **summary** document for each domain
2. Review key capabilities and processes
3. Understand integration points with other domains

### For Technical Teams
1. Review both summary and **detailed** documents
2. Focus on API specifications and data models
3. Understand event flows and integration patterns

### For Implementation Teams
1. Use detailed documents for requirement analysis
2. Reference capability models for design decisions
3. Validate against business process flows

## Cross-Domain Capabilities

Many capabilities span multiple domains:

- **Order-to-Cash**: Order Management → Warehouse Operations → Shipment
- **Inventory Lifecycle**: Product Catalog → Inventory → Warehouse Operations
- **Fulfillment Process**: Order Management → Cartonization → Pack & Ship
- **Returns Process**: Order Management → Inventory → Warehouse Operations

## Capability Maturity Model

Each capability is assessed on a maturity scale:

1. **Basic**: Manual processes with minimal automation
2. **Managed**: Standardized processes with some automation
3. **Optimized**: Fully automated with optimization algorithms
4. **Advanced**: AI/ML-driven with predictive capabilities
