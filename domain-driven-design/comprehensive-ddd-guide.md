## Strategic Design Patterns

### Context Mapping Patterns

#### Shared Kernel

- **Inventory ↔ Physical Tracking**: Share location and quantity

#### Partnership
- **Physical Tracking ↔ Location Master**: Collaborate on locations
- **Shipment Transportation ↔ Yard Management**: Coordinate docks

#### Customer-Supplier
- **Order Management → Warehouse Operations**: Orders flow downstream
- **Wave Planning → Task Execution**: Waves create tasks
- **Pick Execution → Pack & Ship**: Picks feed packing

#### Conformist
- All services conform to Product Catalog for SKUs
- All services conform to Location Master for locations

## Common Domain Patterns

### Aggregate Design Patterns

#### 1. State Machine Pattern
Used in: Order Management, Task Execution, Wave Planning, Returns
```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    CREATED, ALLOCATED, RELEASED, PICKING, PACKING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED
}
```

#### 2. Polymorphic Context Pattern
Used in: Task Execution, Pick Execution
```java
public abstract class TaskContext {
    // Base context
}
public class PickTaskContext extends TaskContext {
    // Specific implementation
}
```

#### 3. Strategy Pattern
Used in: Wave Planning, Robotics Fleet, WES Orchestration
```java
public interface OptimizationStrategy {
    Solution optimize(Problem problem);
}
```

#### 4. Saga Pattern
Used in: WES Orchestration, Order Management
```java
public class SagaCoordinator {
    private CompensationStack compensations;
    // Forward and backward recovery
}
```

#### 5. Event Sourcing Pattern
Used in: WES Orchestration, Inventory, Order Management
```java
public class EventSourcedAggregate {
    private List<DomainEvent> events;
    // Rebuild state from events
}
```

### Value Object Patterns

#### Common Value Objects Across Services

**Dimensional**:
- Dimensions (length, width, height)
- Weight (value, unit)
- Volume (calculated from dimensions)

**Identification**:
- SKU (product identifier)
- LocationCode (warehouse location)
- LicensePlate (container identifier)

**Temporal**:
- TimeWindow (start, end)
- Duration (time span)
- Schedule (recurring time patterns)

**Financial**:
- Money (amount, currency)
- Price (unit price)
- Cost (calculated costs)

**Geographical**:
- Address (shipping/billing)
- Coordinates (x, y, z)
- GPSLocation (lat, long)

## Integration Architecture

### Event-Driven Communication

#### Event Categories

**Lifecycle Events**:
- Created, Updated, Deleted
- Started, Completed, Failed
- Approved, Rejected, Cancelled

**State Change Events**:
- StatusChanged
- PriorityChanged
- AssignmentChanged

**Business Events**:
- OrderPlaced, OrderShipped
- InventoryAllocated, InventoryMoved
- WavePlanned, TaskCompleted
- ReturnApproved, RefundProcessed

#### Event Flow Patterns

**Choreography**: Services react to events independently
- Order → Inventory → Warehouse → Wave → Task

**Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages flow
- WES Orchestration coordinates complex workflows

**Hybrid**: Combination of both patterns
- Normal flow uses choreography
- Exception handling uses orchestration

### API Design

#### Command APIs (Write)
```
POST   /api/v1/{resource}      - Create
PUT    /api/v1/{resource}/{id} - Update
DELETE /api/v1/{resource}/{id} - Delete
POST   /api/v1/{resource}/{id}/{action} - Command
```

#### Query APIs (Read)
```
GET    /api/v1/{resource}      - List
GET    /api/v1/{resource}/{id} - Get by ID
GET    /api/v1/{resource}/search - Search
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Services

1. **Define Bounded Context**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Model Aggregates**: Identify consistency boundaries
3. **Design Value Objects**: Immutable, self-validating
4. **Plan Events**: Define domain events early
5. **Map Integration**: Determine context mapping pattern
6. **Choose Patterns**: Select appropriate DDD patterns

### For Existing Services

1. **Refactor to Aggregates**: Group related entities
2. **Extract Value Objects**: Make concepts explicit
3. **Add Domain Events**: Enable event-driven integration
4. **Implement Repository**: Abstract persistence
5. **Create Anti-Corruption Layer**: Protect from external changes

## Best Practices

### Aggregate Design
- Keep aggregates small and focused
- Enforce invariants within aggregate
- Reference other aggregates by ID only
- One transaction per aggregate

### Event Design
- Make events immutable
- Include all necessary data
- Use past tense for naming
- Version events for evolution

### Service Integration
- Use asynchronous communication when possible
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Cache reference data locally
- Handle eventual consistency

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test domain logic
- Integration test repositories
- Contract test APIs
- End-to-end test critical paths

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics by Layer

**Domain Layer**:
- Business rule violations
- Aggregate operation counts
- Domain event frequencies

**Application Layer**:
- Use case execution times
- Command/query rates
- Transaction success rates

**Infrastructure Layer**:
- Database query times
- Message queue depth
